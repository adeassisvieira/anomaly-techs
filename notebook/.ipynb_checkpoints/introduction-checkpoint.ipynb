    "*Outlier detection and novelty detection are **both used for anomaly detection**, where one is interested in detecting abnormal or unusual observations. Outlier detection is then also known as **unsupervised anomaly detection** and **novelty detection as semi-supervised anomaly detection**. In the context of outlier detection, **the outliers/anomalies cannot form a dense cluster as available estimators assume that the outliers/anomalies are located in low density regions**. On the **contrary, in the context of novelty detection, novelties/anomalies can form a dense cluster as long as they are in a low density region of the training data, considered as normal in this context**.*"
